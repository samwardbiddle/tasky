# This workflow performs security scanning and publishes a Docker image to Amazon ECR
# It runs on pushes to the main branch and uses OIDC for secure AWS authentication
#
# Required setup:
# 1. AWS IAM Role with ECR permissions and GitHub OIDC trust relationship
# 2. AWS ECR repository named 'tasky'
# 3. GitHub secret: AWS_ROLE_ARN with the IAM role ARN
#
# The workflow:
# 1. Runs security scans using Gosec and Trivy
# 2. Builds a Docker image from the repository
# 3. Pushes the image to ECR with the 'latest' tag
