Security Vulnerabilities in This Exercise Implementation

1. S3 Bucket Configuration
Vulnerabilities:
- Public read access enabled on S3 bucket (high risk)
- No encryption at rest configured
- No versioning enabled for backup protection
- No lifecycle policies for backup retention

Remediations:
- Disable public access using s3:BlockPublicAccess
- Enable S3 default encryption using AWS KMS
- Enable versioning for data protection
- Implement lifecycle policies for cost-effective retention

2. MongoDB Configuration
Vulnerabilities:
- MongoDB instance running on public subnet
- Direct internet access to database allowed
- Password stored in environment variables
- No encryption at rest configured for data
- No automated rotation of database credentials

Remediations:
- Move MongoDB to private subnet
- Implement VPC endpoints or bastion hosts for access
- Use AWS Secrets Manager for credential storage
- Enable MongoDB encryption at rest
- Implement automated credential rotation using Secrets Manager

3. EKS Security Issues
Vulnerabilities:
- Cluster-admin privileges granted to application containers
- Public endpoint exposed without IP restrictions
- No pod security policies implemented
- Container running as root user
- No resource limits set on containers

Remediations:
- Implement RBAC with least privilege access
- Enable private endpoint and VPC-only access
- Implement Pod Security Policies or OPA/Gatekeeper
- Use non-root user in container
- Set CPU/memory limits and requests

4. Network Security
Vulnerabilities:
- SSH access allowed from any IP (0.0.0.0/0)
- Database accessible from entire VPC
- No network segmentation
- No WAF or DDoS protection

Remediations:
- Restrict SSH access to specific CIDR ranges
- Implement security groups with specific source IPs
- Use network ACLs and proper subnet segregation
- Deploy AWS WAF and Shield for protection

5. IAM/Permission Issues
Vulnerabilities:
- EC2 instance has full ec2:* permissions
- No role separation
- No AWS Organizations implementation
- Missing permission boundaries

Remediations:
- Implement least privilege access policies
- Create separate roles for different functions
- Use AWS Organizations for account management
- Set IAM permission boundaries

6. Monitoring & Compliance
Vulnerabilities:
- AWS Config missing critical rules
- No CloudTrail logging
- No VPC Flow Logs
- Missing CloudWatch alarms
- No automated compliance checking

Remediations:
- Enable comprehensive AWS Config rules
- Enable CloudTrail with log file validation
- Enable VPC Flow Logs for all VPCs
- Set up CloudWatch alarms for security events
- Implement AWS Security Hub and Config Rules

7. Application Security
Vulnerabilities:
- JWT secret key stored in plain text
- No rate limiting
- Missing input validation
- No SSL/TLS certificate management
- No secrets rotation mechanism

Remediations:
- Use AWS Secrets Manager for JWT keys
- Implement API Gateway with throttling
- Add comprehensive input validation
- Use ACM for certificate management
- Implement automated secret rotation

Best Practices Implementation:
1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security
   - Use AWS CDK with CDK Nag
   - Implement IaC security scanning
   - Version control all infrastructure changes

2. Security Monitoring
   - Enable AWS GuardDuty
   - Implement centralized logging
   - Set up automated security assessments

3. Compliance Framework
   - Implement AWS Control Tower
   - Regular security audits
   - Automated compliance reporting

This file serves as documentation for a technical exercise and intentionally implements these vulnerabilities. DO NOT use these configurations in a production environment.

For production environments, implement all recommended remediations and follow AWS Well-Architected Framework security best practices.
